# trello-tui

A terminal-based Trello client built with Go and [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea). Browse boards, manage cards, and move work across lists — all from your terminal.

## Features

- **Board browser** with fuzzy filtering
- **Kanban board view** with responsive columns and horizontal scrolling
- **Card management** — create, edit, archive, and move cards between lists
- **Card detail view** with multiple panes:
  - Info (title, description, labels, members, due date, URL)
  - Checklists with interactive toggle, create/delete checklists and items
  - Attachments with system viewer integration, URL attachment support, and deletion
  - Activity feed with interlaced comments
- **Label management** — create, edit, and delete board labels; create labels inline from the card picker
- **Inline editing** — title, description, due date, members, and labels
- **Comments** — view and post comments from the activity pane
- **Card filtering** — search across titles, descriptions, members, labels, and due dates
- **Visual indicators** — color-coded labels, member initials, due date warnings, checklist progress
- **Version checking** — notifies you when a newer release is available
- **Keyboard-driven** — Trello-compatible hotkeys, no mouse needed

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.25 or later

  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
  ```

```

Or create a config file at `~/.config/trello-tui/config.json` (Linux) / `~/Library/Application Support/trello-tui/config.json` (macOS):
